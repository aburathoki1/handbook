# Promotions

This guidance is written mostly for line managers. It'll help you understand how promotions work at Made Tech.

You're responsible for supporting people you line manage when they want to get promoted.

## When should I encourage someone to apply for promotion?

It's difficult to provide a one-size-fits-all answer to this question, but ultimately this decision is made when both you and the individual you line manage feel that individual is ready to take on a new role. Signs this might be the case could include:

- They exhibit some or all of the core competencies for their desired role
- They are consistently evidencing some or all attributes that are described in the [SFIA level](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8/sfia-8) that corresponds to their desired role
- They have examples of exemplary work or feedback received
- They have received endorsement from the leads of their current project
- They display the potential to succeed in the desired role

## How do I seek promotion for someone?

Team members may apply for any open role in their career path listed on our careers page via [Workable](https://referrals.workable.com/made-tech/jobs/). If the role the individual you line manage is interested in a role that is not listed on this list please inform your head of team so we can collate date about our internal demand.
You can find more information about the promotions process in our [Promotion Guidance for client facing team members](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LjchEGWCVxeyCo4PTYZxd1PL0DKPUx_8AoT3F67ifoo/edit) or Promotion Guidance for our group facing team members (link will be updated soon)


### What should I do if the promotion case is unsuccessful?

In the event the promotion application is unsuccessful, feedback will be provided by the interviewing panel and the team members will have the opportunity to appeal.
